Hi, my name is Carlos Colorado and I am a full stack web developer. I am a `UNIX` and `vim`
lover, who dwells every now and then on gaming, although I don't really have that much time for
the last one. My motivations for writing a blog are perhaps among the most common ones.
Creating habits, exercise linguistic abilities, improve thought processes and self
reference stuff that I find really useful but often forget.

One of the most immediate motivations for writing this blog is to get a chance to practice typing
on my new `ergodox` keyboards. I used to be a touch typist until I got these keyboards,
they posses certain characteristics that will show how to correctly type, of course that
also means that they will show you what you where doing wrong.  They do require some time to get
used to, but I believe is worth the investment.

I am eager to write about them but I want to make a post worthy of them on a near future.

I will consider this a success if I can review a six months old post and understand how
much my ability to express an idea has improved.

_Why Jekyll ?_ well I wanted something really simple that would not distract me from
writing. I don't want to trade simplicity for "feature-fullness".

* Edit on vim without require me to jump through many hoops or hack-ish workarounds.
* Supports mark-up for edition.
* Easy to host with configurable styling.
* Could be maintain form any machine and without much setup required.
* Easy code posting with highlighting.

So far Jekyll seems to agree with all my requirements, so I am very optimistic about it.
I will probably integrate a commenting platform, I am thinking `disqus`.

Happy Pi day.
